My first website was not great. It was buggy, ugly and horrible on mobile. That was because I had no idea what I was doing. I didn't pretend like I did either. I built it using nothing but HTML & CSS. I lied to myself saying I used JS, but we all know I copied the little bit of JS off google.

I went away for a while focusing on uni and learning JS properly, and I realised how bad that website really is.
Anyway, I learned JS properly, including React, along with TailwindCSS and decided to give it another shot since I really enjoyed learning front-end. This is my final product, and I think its miles better than the original. Fast forward 3 months when I hate it again I guess, but for now, I think this is good.

I think the next step from here is probably do more work into back-end since i've been neglecting it a lot since starting React. Java or Python? Or step out of the comfort zone and learn something new like Go or Kotlin?

UPDATE 10 FEB 2025: that didnt take long. i want to change the website again. also ive been learning C, its really fun. ill finish what im working on right now then get back to changing this website
